This article will describe how to create a complete and simple water shader with animated surface geometry, reflection, refraction and foam. This effect relies on an empirical approach rather than an accurate BRDF. We are not taking subsurface scattering or realistic caustics into account here. Our goal is to get a nice, easy and configurable effect.
