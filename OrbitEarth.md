This small project is just designed to be a platform for the integration of Eric Bruneton's [atmospheric scattering](http://www-ljk.imag.fr/Publications/Basilic/com.lmc.publi.PUBLI_Article@11e7cdda2f7_f64b69/article.pdf) post process.
It's also a good opportunity for the space passionate I am to create beautiful renders of our planet and its satellites.
Nothing too fancy here, this is a deferred renderer with a PBR workflow and a logarithmic depth buffer to handle large distances.
A bit of work is done on the cloud layer to give it some volume, especially by faking its shadows on Earth surface.
