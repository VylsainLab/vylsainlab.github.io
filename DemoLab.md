When trying to implement new rendering techniques, it's always easier to have a simple project ready to be modified and configured.
DemoLab serve that purpose and allowed me to tweak my PBR workflow and develop some procedural shaders like snow and water. An ImGui interface allows me to adjust parameters at runtime.

## Features

* C++ / OpenGL engine
* Mixed renderer : deferred renderer + forward pass for transparent geometry
* PBR workflow
* Image based lighting 
* Shadow mapping
* Light bloom
* SSAO
* ImGui based interface
* Procedural snow material
* Animated water surface
