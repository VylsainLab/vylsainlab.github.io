title: About me
---

My name is Sylvain Melin and I am a graphics programmer. I use a camera to capture the beauty of our world and a computer to recreate it.  
What I like about my job and especially the graphics field is that with basic hardware, some knowledge in physics and maths, you can create pretty much what you want, from a water drop refracting light on a windshield to a full real-time solar system.

I spent 7 years modelling Earth for a professional flight simulator manufacturer. I am now looking forward to expend my skills in graphics programming and join a team of passionate people with an ambitious project.
