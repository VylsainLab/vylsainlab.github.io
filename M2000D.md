title: Mirage 2000D
---


In 2011, to finalize my Bachelor's degree, I did an internship at the Arm√©e de l'Air (French air force) aircraft maintenance center of Clermont-Ferrand.
Part of the research department team, my job there was to create a proof of concept for a Mirage 2000D INS procedure trainer on Flight Simulator X, to study how virtual tools could be used for training personnel.
The process involved modeling the aircraft and instruments, recreating a full interactive INS alignment procedure and writing a tutorial that the team could build upon.

Walking around a Mirage 2000D, sitting in its cockpit, witnessing the power of its M53 turbine during a full afterburner test... those were awesome moments for the young programmer and aviation passionate that I was. :)
