Among many other tasks, my main role as a software engineer at Alsim Simulators was to design and implement our flight simulator's image generator (IG). This is quite a specific field in that the final product is designed for professional pilots training rather than entertainment activities.
This page will list the main features of this engine and show a few renders. 
I will write a dedicated blog post to give a more technical insight of such developments.

## Features

* 60 Hz guaranteed renderer
* Cylindrical and "cave" projection warping
* Planet sized : the terrain rendering algorithm allows you to render Earth seamlessly from orbit to a few centimetres above the ground
* Accurate dataset : I mixed the latest and most reliable data coming from various space agencies as well as vector data sources like Openstreetmap to get the best representation of Earth. 
* On-the-fly vector data rasterization (roads and railways)
* Worldwide procedurally generated airports with sloped runway, custom scenery on demand
* Dynamic weather with 2 layers of clouds, precipitations, volumetric fog and runway contamination
* EASA FNPT II / FAA FTD Level 5 certified
